1 order has many order_lines

# one-to-few
This is the current approach. We embed order_lines in order.

# one-to-many
when 1 order starts to have many order_lines, embedding whole order_lines in order may not be a good idea.
Instead, we only embed order_lines' _id in order, and store order_lines in a separate collection.

# one-to-squillions
if 1 order has A LOT of order_lines, we should not embed order_lines in order.
Instead, we should reference order's _id in order_lines.
